# reading-level-classification
Files and report for a classifier model that determines text reading level

## Source

This project was made as part of COMP135: Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining, in Spring 2025, at Tufts University. The project specification can be found [here](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/135/2025s/projectA.html).


## Notes

Problem 1 is a model that uses the "bag of words" representation of text to perform the task.

Problem 2 is a model that uses a different embedding schema, and a multi-layer perceptron classifier.
